# Project Rules for Test History

You are working on the Test History project. You must adhere to the following strictly, without requiring input from the user:

## Behavior
*   Add automated tests for any new features or bug fixes. If reasonable, add a test that fails before fixing a bug.
*   Never output code that breaks the `npm run verify` chain.

## The "Definition of Done" Protocol
Before telling the user a task is complete, you MUST perform these 3 steps in order (or run the `npm run verify` shortcut):

1.  **LINT**: Run `npm run lint` (and `npm run lint -- --fix` if needed).
2.  **TEST**: Run `npm test`. All tests must pass.
3.  **BUILD**: Run `npm run build` (This compiles the code but does *not* create the Windows executable).

## Documentation
* You must maintain `copilot_journal.md`. 
* After the verification steps pass, add an entry to the journal
* Include the date and time for each entry (based on user's local time, Pacific)
* Include the user's prompt text, verbatim
* Summarize the changes
* Note any changes to files, architecture, or design
